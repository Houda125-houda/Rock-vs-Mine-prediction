# Submarine have to know if the enemy country have planted some mines " explosives that explodes when some object comes in contact with it " in the ocean
# So the submarine need to predict whether it is crossing a mine or a rock 
# so Sonar  sends sound signals and review switchbacks " le fait de revenir " so this signal is then processed to detect whether the object is just a mine or a rock in the ocean 
# the sonar send and receive signals  bounce back " be returned" from metal cylindre and some rocks because mines will be made of metals
# we will use logistic regression model because it works very well for binary classification problem
